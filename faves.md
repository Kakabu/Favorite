# Andrew and Abby's Favorite Things (just like the musical!)


## Abby


> I love watermelon, and I hope to someday grow giant watermelon.  It's a really weird and involved process.  Apparently if you:
>> 1. Sing to your watermelon
>> 2. Name the watermelon
>> 3. Put fans on the watermelon
>> 4. Read stories to the watermelon

> it'll grow faster and bigger... don't ask me why.

## Andrew

> I really like my cat. His name is Pockets and he's pretty great!

> Here are a few important steps for caring for your feline comrade.

>> 1. Make sure they are fed and watered _every single_ day!
>> 2. Brush them and pet them whenever possible (_if they'll let you_!)
>> 3. If they are spade/neutered and have a collar/name tag along with all of their shots, it is safe to let them outside.
